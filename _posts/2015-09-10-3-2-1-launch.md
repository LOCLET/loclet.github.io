Yesterday was the day. More precisely, the night before yesterday was the night.

The night we were finally released from what felt like the longest wait in the history of iOS app review times.

Although we seem to have endured [a pretty common fate](http://appreviewtimes.com/ios/distribution-chart), we had the
special pleasure of first waiting 7 days, then being asked to submit a video that explains our iOS app, then having 
to wait another 9 days until we finally received that desperately awaited status: Released! Water under the bridge 
now...

The amazing news is - drumroll - WE ARE LIVE!
