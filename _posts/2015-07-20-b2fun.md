We love walking through cities. You know that. What you didn’t know is that we sometimes also run through them.

At least that’s what we did last Thursday, following a short-notice invitation to [B2RUN](http://www.b2run.de/). B2RUN 
is Munich’s biggest corporate run event featuring Munich’s beautiful [Olympic Park](http://www.olympiapark.de/) and 
over 30,000 runners.

What can we say? A delegation of five brave LOCLET souls ran the 6.1km track from start to finish. It was fun. It was
**very** warm (33°C). There was beer at the end.

And best of all: We had cool LOCLET running shirts featuring one of our upcoming game achievements - the racing snail
 ;-). Prost!
