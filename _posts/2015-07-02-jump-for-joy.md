In the olden days, we would have written paragraphs of text about an awesome LOCLET team event we did back in May.

About how we climbed up a mountain near Garmisch and spent two days in a nice log cabin, brainstorming away with game
ideas for our app, enjoying unexpectedly sunny weather, Venezuelan-Bavarian fusion cuisine, Croation schnaps and 
rounds of chess and poker. We would have elaborated on how we hiked to a small lake and chopped firewood that would 
keep us warm during the night.
 
But those were the days before the GIF. With todayâ€™s great technology we can sum up all of these things in just one 
image:
