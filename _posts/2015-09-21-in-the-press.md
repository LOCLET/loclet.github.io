Ever wondered how LOCLET got started? We could tell you right now, but actually there was some nice coverage in the 
German press recently, so we’ll just share some of that here.

Munich’s local paper “Münchner Merkur” had a detailed feature on the idea and the founding story behind LOCLET:

Even more recently, [gruenderszene.de](http://www.gruenderszene.de) - Germany’s leading online magazine on startups - 
featured us as part of their Startup Scanner section.

That’s it for today. We might occasionally reference more press snippets in this blog. At any rate, we’re relieved to
know that now you’re in the know.
