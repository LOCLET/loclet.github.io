Now that we have started our blog, it’s time to recap some of the LOCLET developments that took place at the end of 
last year. One of the highlights definitely was the [Games Bavaria](http://www.games-bavaria.com/) XMas Pitching 
Event at [WERK1 Munich](http://www.werk1muenchen.de/). We were invited (rather spontaneously) to present the LOCLET 
game concept along with four other teams pitching their ideas.

There was a good variety of ideas and teams (some of them from [MD.H Munich](http://www.mediadesign.de/)) - ranging 
from early concepts to full-blown prototypes. Pitches were 8 minutes each, a jury of four experts from the game 
industry gave immediate feedback and decided on an overall ranking after all teams had pitched.

To cut a long story short: We won the pitch, both by vote of the jury and the audience. Needless to say we were 
thrilled but also a bit surprised, because we didn’t start LOCLET from a classic games development perspective. We 
especially appreciated the detailed and valuable feedback of the jurors. And would like to congratulate all other 
teams for their great ideas - there was a ton of very cool and creative stuff out there!

PS: The first prize was the use of the very cool WERK1 event space for an evening. So watch out for one of those 
upcoming LOCLET events (a launch party maybe? ;-) to be held at WERK1!
